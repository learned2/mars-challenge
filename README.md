# Mars Weather Data Analysis

## Overview
This project involves scraping, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing weather data from Mars, with a focus on key environmental variables such as temperature, pressure, and Martian year length (sols). The analysis aims to explore the seasonal variations and correlations in the Martian environment, which is crucial for future space exploration and potential human habitation on Mars.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following key components:
1. **Web Scraping**: Using `splinter` and `BeautifulSoup` to scrape data from a Mars weather website.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Preparing the data by converting columns to appropriate data types and handling any missing values or outliers.
3. **Data Analysis**: Performing various statistical analyses on the temperature, pressure, and year length (sol) data, including summary statistics, correlations, and seasonal variations.
4. **Data Visualization**: Generating visualizations to help interpret and present the data, including histograms, time series plots, and bar charts.
